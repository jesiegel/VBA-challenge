# VBA-challenge

In this challenge, I used VBA to loop through the stocks data. The script goes through all stocks for a specific year and produces financial information that includes the ticker symbol, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of that year, percent change from the opening price to the closing price, and the total stock volume. Included in this repository is the script file, as well as images that present the outcome.
